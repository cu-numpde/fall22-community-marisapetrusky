## Software: Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas Time-accurate Analyzer (SPARTA) 

SPARTA is a parallelized Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver for simulating low-density gases in 2D or 3D. The PDE being solved is known as the Boltzmann Equation, which governs advection of particles through physical and velocity space. The primary audience of SPARTA is aerospace engineers studying flow interactions in the upper layers of the atmosphere or in vacuum-chamber experiments, as this is where one might typically find low-density gases. In particular, Sandia and NASA Ames are the two primary affiliations of the software.
